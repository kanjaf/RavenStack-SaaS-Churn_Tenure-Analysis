# RavenStack SaaS Churn & Tenure Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer retention and churn for a SaaS (Software as a Service) business. By examining customer **Tenure** (how long they stay) and **Churn** (why and when they leave), this analysis aims to identify key risk factors and provide actionable insights to improve customer lifetime value.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Identify Churn Patterns:** Determine the critical months where customers are most likely to cancel.
* **Tenure Segmentation:** Group customers by their longevity to understand the behavior of "long-term loyalists" vs. "early-churners."
* **Revenue Impact:** Correlate churn rates with monthly recurring revenue (MRR) to quantify financial loss.
* **Predictive Indicators:** Isolate variables (e.g., usage frequency, support tickets) that serve as early warning signs for churn.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Environment:** Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries:** * `Pandas` (Data Manipulation)
    * `NumPy` (Numerical Analysis)
    * `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` (Data Visualization)
    * `Scikit-learn` (Statistical Modeling)
